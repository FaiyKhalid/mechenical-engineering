In this task we asked to create a robot arm 
First I download the parts from the smart method gethub 
Second I decided to go with tinkercad as a 3D main program for this task 
Then I started collecting the parts by following these steps
1- setting up the base first and adjusting the dimentions 
2- gathering the base with base covering 
3- collecting the first arm with the second base 
4- adjusting the first arm with the second arm 
5- stabilizing the handle (gripper) at the end of the arm
